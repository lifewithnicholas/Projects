Uses the database we built earlier for Users, Accounts, and Transactions.

Can display balances, account details, deposits, and withdrawals.

Has two interfaces:

    Online Banking (terminal-based for now, but can later be a Flask/Django web app).

    ATM mode (simplified menu for quick actions).

Creating an application to provide temporary phone numbers for receiving texts and phone calls on both Android and iOS involves several key steps. Here's a high-level guide for building such an app:

Key Features for the App:

Temporary Phone Numbers: Users should be able to select temporary phone numbers to use for a specific period or purpose (e.g., for privacy, verification, etc.).

Receive Text Messages: Allow users to receive SMS messages on their temporary number.

Receive Phone Calls: Allow users to receive phone calls to their temporary number.

Number Expiry: Set an expiration period for each temporary number (e.g., 1 day, 1 week).

Multiple Numbers: Provide users with the ability to create multiple temporary numbers for different purposes.

History & Notifications: Store received texts and call logs temporarily, and notify the user about any incoming communications.

Privacy & Security: Ensure the app does not leak users' real phone numbers and complies with privacy laws.

Technology Stack

Backend:

Twilio or Plivo for providing virtual phone numbers and handling SMS/voice calls.

Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or Ruby on Rails for server-side development.

Firebase for real-time notifications, authentication, and database.

Frontend (Mobile):

Android: Kotlin or Java with Android SDK.

iOS: Swift with Xcode.

Cross-platform (Optional): React Native or Flutter.

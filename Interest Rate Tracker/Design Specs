# Interest Rate & Loan Cost Tracker – Design Spec

## 1) Goal

Build a production-grade tool for a retail bank to (a) track and forecast interest rates and (b) translate those forecasts into customer-facing affordability metrics for home mortgages and auto loans.

**Primary users**

* Treasury / ALM team (rate risk, funding plans)
* Consumer lending (pricing, promo planning)
* Digital product (customer affordability widgets)

**Primary outputs**

* Daily dashboards for current benchmarks and internal rate sheets
* 1–24 month forecasts with uncertainty bands
* Scenario engine (shocks, parallel shifts, steepening/flattening)
* Loan affordability & payment calculators wired to forecasts

## 2) KPIs

* Forecast MAE / RMSE by tenor and product
* Backtest hit rate for directionality (up/down) over 1, 3, 6 months
* Quote-to-close conversion lift from affordability widget
* Latency from data arrival → model update (<30 min target)

## 3) Data Sources (authoritative)

* **FRED**: SOFR (SOFR), Fed Funds Effective (FEDFUNDS), 2Y/10Y Treasury (DGS2, DGS10), 30Y fixed mortgage (MORTGAGE30US), CPI (CPIAUCSL), Unemployment (UNRATE), Retail sales (RSAFS)
* **ICE / CME**: SOFR futures (for implied path, if licensed)
* **Internal**: funding costs, deposit betas, rate sheets, booked loan yields

## 4) Architecture

**Ingestion & Validation**

* Batch pulls from FRED API (hourly), SOFR futures (daily), internal S3/warehouse tables (Snowflake/BigQuery).
* Data contracts: schema + range checks + freshness SLAs via Great Expectations.

**Storage**

* Bronze (raw), Silver (clean, aligned calendar), Gold (features) in Delta Lake or BigQuery.

**Modeling Layer**

* Modular pipelines per target: `fed_funds`, `sofr`, `ust_curve`, `mortgage30`, `auto_apr`.
* Feature store with lags, calendar effects, macro covariates, futures-implied expectations.

**Serving**

* REST/GraphQL microservice for forecasts & scenarios.
* Scheduled retrains (daily) + on-demand backtests.

**Observability**

* MLflow for experiments; Evidently AI for drift; Grafana for data/model health.

## 5) Forecasting Approach

* **Nowcasting**: Kalman filter to smooth noisy dailies; ridge regression with lagged features for 1–3m.
* \*\*Curve modeling
